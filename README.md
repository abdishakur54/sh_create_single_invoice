About
============
Purpose of the module is to create a single invoice from multiple sale orders/delivery orders. Sometimes we have the same customer which are not invoiced so at that time it's easy to maintain one invoice for every sale order. So choose the sales orders from the list view and generate invoice!

Installation
============
1) Copy module files to addon folder.
2) Restart odoo service (sudo service odoo-server restart).
3) Go to your odoo instance and open apps (make sure to activate debug mode).
4) click on update app list.
5) search module name and hit install button.
